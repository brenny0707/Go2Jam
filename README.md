# Go2Jam

## MVP
Go2Jam is a rhythm game that uses a variety of keyboard buttons to hit notes (this version uses four keys). Core features include:

### Timing Bar
The game consists of a board with four columns, each having notes scroll downwards. Near the bottom is a bar where players should press the respective key in time with the beat to get the note. If they time the key while the note is in the timing bar, they get a point. Otherwise, the note won't count towards their score.

### Score system
When players time the notes to the timing bar, there should be a score to keep track of the player's progress.

### A selection of difficulties
Since everyone has a different skill level, the game should incorporate a way to change the difficulty of the song to make it more approachable or challenging depending on the individual.

### Menu
In order to choose the difficulty, a menu needs to be implemented to allow players to choose the difficulty they wish to play.

## Bonus

### Multiple songs

If there is additional time available, incorporating multiple songs with new beatmaps would increase the diversity of the game.
