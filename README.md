# Go2Jam

## MVP
Go2Jam is a rhythm game that uses a variety of keyboard buttons to hit notes (this version uses four keys). Core features include:

- Synchronized notes during gameplay
- A selection of songs

## Technologies, Libraries, APIs

- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- A form of Web Audio/Music API

## Wireframes

The game consists of a board with four columns, each having notes scroll downwards. Near the bottom is a bar where players should press the respective key in time with the beat to get the note. If they time the key while the note is in the timing bar, they get a point. Otherwise, the note won't count towards their score.
